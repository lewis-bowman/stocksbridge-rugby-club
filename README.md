# Stocksbridge Rugby
I created this website as a page for my local rugby club to share information with supporters, players and sponsors, as well as providing an ideal platform to attract new players. Due to the size of the club, only a simple website containing the basics (who are we, where are we etc.) was needed to fulfil the needs of the club.
Using mainly HTML5 and CSS3, with a small amount of JavaScript incorporated, the website fulfils all possible needs of the visitor, and provides them with enough information to answer any basic questions they might have.
## UX
This website is primarily for the players and supporters of Stocksbridge Rugby Club to use as an information resource, however is also an opportunity for the club to attract new players and sponsors that may be interested in getting involved.
I created the website with simplicity in mind. Knowing the players and supporters of the team, a website that was simple and logical to use is the best option. By keeping it simple, I can ensure that the website always helps visitors, as they will be able to find what they need even if they haven’t visited before. 
Providing an online resource that is personal to the club also helps promote the club to sponsors, who can provide much needed resources and help. By drawing in new sponsors, I can help promote the future of the club. 
**User Stories**
While creating the website, I wanted the visitor to be able to achieve the following:
* As a player, I want to be able to find out when and where my next game is.
* As a potential new player, I want to contact the club via a form, to see if I can play for them.
* As a supporter, I want to be able to find them on social media, so I can find out the latest news and events.
* As a parent of a player, I want to know what teams are available for my child.
* As a board member, I want to be able to access the yearbook, so I can read it.
* As an opposition player, I want to find out where the pitch is, so I can arrive on time.
* As an opposition supporter, I want to find out where the club house is, so I can buy a drink.
* As a local supporter, I want to see who sponsors the team, so I can use local services and help the local economy.

## Technologies Used
In this project, I have used a variety of languages, frameworks, libraries and other tools to create a website for my rugby club. I have had to prioritise what I use and how, and my decisions are listed below:
1. HTML5 - The project uses **HTML5** to create a universal webpage that can be accessed on any medium.
2. CSS3 - The project uses **CSS3** to create universal styling, that is supported in all browsers.
3. Bootstrap - The project uses **Bootstrap** as it provides an easy to use framework and fleshed out library, while maintaining a professional and modern look to the website.
4. Font Awesome - The project uses **Font Awesome** to create simple and recognisable icons across the website, and enhance the user’s experience.
5. Twitter API - The project uses an embedded **Twitter API** to allow users to see current club news and provide the site with a dynamic feature.
